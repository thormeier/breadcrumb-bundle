BreadcrumbBundle
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thormeier/breadcrumb-bundle.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thormeier/breadcrumb-bundle)

## Introduction

This Symfony bundle provides integration of breadcrumbs via route config and rendering in your Twig templates.
This bundle is heavily inspired by the inactive [https://github.com/xi-project/xi-bundle-breadcrumbs](https://github.com/xi-project/xi-bundle-breadcrumbs)

## Installation / Getting started

### Step 1: Composer require

    $ php composer.phar require "thormeier/breadcrumb-bundle"

### Step2: Enable the bundle in the kernel

    <?php
    // app/AppKernel.php
    
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new Thormeier\BreadcrumbBundle\ThormeierBreadcrumbBundle(),
            // ...
        );
    }

## Configuration

Enable the bundle in your config.yml:

    # config.yml
    thormeier_breadcrumb: ~

The template defaults to a basic one, providing a `<ul>` with `<li>` and `<a>` for every breadcrumb.

## Usage

### Basic

A breadcrumb tree is created by the fields `label` and `parent_route` in the `defaults` of a route. Basic tree example:

    # routing.yml
    
    acme_demo_home:
        path: /
        options:
            breadcrumb:
                label: Home
    
    acme_demo_contact:
        path: /contact
        options:
            breadcrumb:
                label: Contact
                parent_route: acme_demo_home
    
    acme_demo_catalogue:
        path: /catalogue
        options:
            breadcrumb:
                label: 'Our Catalogue'
                parent_route: acme_demo_home
    
    acme_demo_catalogue_categories:
        path: /catalogue/categories
        options:
            breadcrumb:
                label: 'All categories'
                parent_route: acme_demo_catalogue

Would result in a breadcrumb tree like:

    acme_demo_home
        |- acme_demo_contact
        `- acme_demo_catalogue
           `- acme_demo_catalogue_categories

If the current route is `acme_demo_catalogue`, the breadcrumbs would for instance show the following:

    Home > Our Catalogue

Since the configuration of the breadcrumbs happens on routing config, it's generally agnostic from _how_ the routing 
configuration happens. This means that configuring breadcrumbs for instance via annotations is perfectly possible:

    /**
     * ...
     * @Route(
     *    "/contact",
     *    name="acme_demo_contact",
     *    options={
     *        "breadcrumb" = {
     *            "label" = "Contact",
     *            "parent_route" = "acme_demo_home"
     *        }
     *    })
     * ...
     */

The configuration can also be done in XML and PHP.

### Dynamic routes

If you happen to have dynamic routes or dynamic translations that you need in your breadcrumbs, they 
can be defined like so:

    # routing.yml
    
    acme_demo_product_detail:
        path: /products/{id}
        options:
            breadcrumb:
                label: 'Produkt: %%name%%'
                parent_route: acme_demo_catalogue

(This example uses a string with a placeholder in the routing directly. You can also define the label text in a 
translation file and only use the translation key as the label. The template will handle the translation and 
replacing.)

**Notice the double `%` to escape the parameter in the label. This needs to be done, because `routing.yml` 
is being parsed by the Symfony container and recognizes constructs, such as `%name%` as a container parameter 
and tries to inject those. The double-`%` escapes it, the template is handling the rest.**

You can then set parameters for both directly on the `Breadcrumb` object, for instance:

    <?php
    // MyController
    
    // ...
    
    public function productDetailAction()
    {
        $product = ...;
    
        // ...
    
        $this->get('thormeier_breadcrumb.breadcrumb_provider')
            ->getBreadcrumbByRoute('acme_demo_product_detail')
            ->setRouteParams(array(
                'id' => $product->getId(),
            ))
            ->setLabelParams(array(
                'name' => $product->getName(),
            ));
            
        // ...
    }

Please note that the breadcrumb must be defined on the route in order to set parameters.

### Dynamic breadcrumbs

If you happen to have a dynamic routing tree, for instance a tree of category pages that can go infinitely deep, 
you can add breadcrumbs that are not defined on a route on the fly. For instance like this:

    <?php
    
    use Thormeier\BreadcrumbBundle\Model\Breadcrumb;
    
    // ...
    
    // Route of the product, we want the categories before this
    $productCrumb = $breadcrumbProvder->getBreadcrumbByRoute('acme_demo_product_detail');
    $collection = $breadcrumbProvider->getBreadcrumbs();
    
    foreach ($product->getCategories() as $category) {
        $newCrumb = new Breadcrumb(
            'Category: %name%',              // Label
            'acme_demo_category',            // Route
            ['id' => $category->getId()],    // Route params
            ['name' => $category->getName()] // Label params
        );
        
        // Adds $newCrumb right in front of $productCrumb
        $collection->addBreadcrumbBeforeCrumb($newCrumb, $productCrumb);
        
        // Or: ->addBreadcrumb(), ->addBreadcrumbAtPosition(), ->addBreadcrumbAfterCrumb(), ->addBreadcrumbToStart()
    }

These breadcrumbs are not stored in the cache though.

### Displaying in twig

Call the twig extension as following:

    {# someTemplate.html.twig #}
    {# ... #}
    
    {{ breadcrumbs() }}
    
    {# ... #}

### Using the bootstrap template

The bundle also provides a default implementation for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/breadcrumb/). It can be used as follows:

    # config.yml
    thormeier_breadcrumb:
        template: @ThormeierBreadcrumb/breadcrumbs_bootstrap.html.twig

### Replacing the default template

If you want to use a custom template, add the following to your config.yml

    # config.yml
    thormeier_breadcrumb:
        template: 'my twig template path'

Your custom breadcrumb template receives a variable called `breadcrumbs` that is a collection that represents your 
breadcrumbs, ordered by highest in the tree to lowest.

A single `breadcrumb` has the fields `route`, `routeParameters`, `label` and `labelParameters`. `route` and `routeParameters` 
are used to generate a path in twig, i.e. `path(breadcrumb.route, breadcrumb.routeParameters)`, whereas `label` and 
`labelParameters` are used to generate the text for the breadcrumb, i.e. 
`{{ (breadcrumb.label)|trans(breadcrumb.labelParameters) }}`

Your custom template might look something like this:

    {# myBreadcrumbs.html.twig #}

    <div>
        {% for breadcrumb in breadcrumbs %}
            <a href="{{ path(breadcrumb.route, breadcrumb.routeParameters) }}">
                {{ breadcrumb.label|replace({"%%": "%"})|trans(breadcrumb.labelParameters) }}
            </a>
        {% endfor %}
    </div>

**The replacing of `%%` with single `%` happens inside the template. See *"Dynamic routes"* as why this is needed.**

Have a look at `Resources/views/breadcrumbs.html.twig` and `Resources/views/breadcrumbs_bootstrap.html.twig` to see the default implementations.

### Customize implementations

The model class and/or its collection can be replaced by own implementations, that implement the 
`Thormeier\BreadcrumbBundle\Model\BreadcrumbInterface` and 
`Thormeier\BreadcrumbBundle\Model\BreadcrumbCollectionInterface`:

    # config.yml
    thormeier_breadcrumb:
        model_class: Acme\Breadcrumbs\Model\MyModel
        collection_class: Acme\Breadcrumbs\Model\MyCollection

The provider service ID can be replaced by setting the parameter `provider_service_id`

    # config.yml
    thormeier_breadcrumb:
        provider_service_id: acme.breadcrumbs.my_provider

### Caching

This bundle uses the routing cache to store breadcrumb lists per route on `cache:warmup`. They are then turned into 
a `BreadcrumbCollection` on demand.

## Slides

A slideshow presenting the bundle and explaining some concepts a little further is available on slideshare: 
[http://www.slideshare.net/Thormeier/thormeierbreadcrumbbundle](http://www.slideshare.net/Thormeier/thormeierbreadcrumbbundle)

## Development

To execute tests locally, execute the following command:

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

The folder `coverage/` is ignored by git, it can therefore be used for generating coverage reports with `phpunit --coverage-html ./coverage/`.
